# Activity 6 : Playing Elevens    

## Questions  
1. You could either remove the 5 of clubs and the 6 of clover or the 5 of clover and 6 of clover.   

2. Yes, every turn , two cards are removed, unless it is a J, Q, and K. Thus, the amount of cards remaining on the board without there being a full J, Q, and K set must always be an even number, otherwise there is a full J, Q, and K.  

3.This game does not involve any strategy since none of the pairs of cards that add to eleven overlap, thus it is pure luck based on which cards are drawn every time one replaces a pair.
